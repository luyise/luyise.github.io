collection: publications
category: manuscripts

excerpt: "We introduce in this paper a definition of (non necessarily positive) opetopes where faces are organised in a poset. Then we show that this description is equivalent to that given in terms of constellations by Kock, Joyal, Batanin and Mascari."
