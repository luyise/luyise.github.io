title: "A Type Theory for Presheaves Over a Reedy Category"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: "We introduce a small type theory whose models are precisely the pesheaves over a given Reedy category C with a given system of coverings, satisfying a certain assumption of local finiteness and presentability. Our work is directly inspired from the Globular Type Theory of Benjamin, Finster and Mimram, and the Simplicial Type Theory of Riehl and Shulman"
